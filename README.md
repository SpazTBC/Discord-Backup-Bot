# Functionalities:

Create Channels: You can use the !create_channels command followed by the number of channels you want to create. It will generate multiple text and voice channels with random names.

Delete All Channels: The !delete_all_channels command will delete all channels in the server.

Backup Channels: With the !backup command, the bot will create a backup of all channels in the server and save the information to a JSON file. Additionally, it will send this backup file along with the command log to an API.

Return Backup: Using the !returnback command, the bot will restore the channels from the previously created backup.

Backup Roles: The !backup_roles command creates a backup of all roles in the server and saves the information to a JSON file. It also sends this backup file along with the command log to an API.

Restore Roles: With the !restore_roles command, the bot will restore the roles from the previously created backup.

Delete All Roles: The !delete_all_roles command deletes all roles in the server except the default @everyone role.

# API Information:

Purpose: The API is designed to receive data from the Discord bot, specifically backup files containing information about channels and roles, as well as command logs.

Endpoint: The API endpoint is set to http://localhost:5000/api, which means it's hosted locally on the machine running the API script and is accessible through the specified port (5000).

Functionality: When the API receives a POST request to the /api endpoint, it expects to receive backup files (JSON format) along with a command log file. It then processes this data, possibly storing it in a database or performing other operations based on the application's requirements.

Error Handling: The API is designed to handle various error scenarios, such as missing files or invalid requests. It responds with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to indicate the nature of the problem.

File Storage: Upon receiving the backup files and command log, the API saves these files to a specified directory on the server for further processing or archival purposes.

Overall, the API acts as a bridge between the Discord bot and any external systems or services that may need to interact with the data generated by the bot.
